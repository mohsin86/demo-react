telling  react app that we have a global state
Provider: makes the Redux store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in the connect function
After this, instead of rendering our App component directly, we render it through our Provider using the store that weâ€™ve created like so:
 */
const store = createStore(reducer);

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
